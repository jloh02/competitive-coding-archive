# NOI Singapore 2019
My first competitive coding competition! Brute forced my way to Bronze.

## Overview
Award: Bronze Medal
Points: 108
Organized By: National University of Singapore

## Solutions
### 1. Pilot
Points: 55/100

I clearly couldn't think of using a stack (optimal solution) so I simply did a smart brute force. Using fast input gave me one extra subtask.
```cpp
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
cin.tie(NULL);
cout.tie(NULL);
```

### 2. Lasers
Points: 41/100

Likewise, procedural programming with some brute force. Did the later subtasks and not 1 and 2 because they're worth more points.

### 3. Feast
Points: 12/100

Just some subtask claiming brute force solution.
